Frontend- html5/css3

DJango Framework-
●	This framework is based on the Model View Template(MVT) pattern. 
●	Django web applications typically group the code that handles each of these steps into separate files as follows-
o	urls.py- A URL mapper is used to redirect HTTP requests to the appropriate view based on the request URL.
o	views.py- A view is a request handler function, which receives HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses. Views access the data needed to satisfy requests via models, and delegate the formatting of the response to templates.
o	models.py- Models are Python objects that define the structure of an application's data, and provide mechanisms to manage (add, modify, delete) and query records in the database. 
o	Templates- All templates are present in the templates directory. A template is a text file defining the structure or layout of a file (such as an HTML page), with placeholders used to represent actual content. A view can dynamically create an HTML page using an HTML template, populating it with data from a model.
